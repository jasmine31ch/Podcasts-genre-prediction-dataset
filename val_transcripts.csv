Kankyupasins stems from the disobedience of the first sin. It unsettles man's moral faculties and, without being in itself an offense, inclines man to commit sins. Because man is a composite being, spirit and body, there already exists a certain tension in him, a certain struggle of tendencies between spirits and flesh develops. But in fact, this struggle belongs to the heritage of sin. It is a consequence of sin, and at the same time a confirmation of it. It is part of the daily experience of the spiritual battle, as St. John Paul II stated,"

And that also compromises the juridical process. And so to realize, again, all of these things have consequences. All of our sins have consequences. They have eternal consequences, right? They cut us off from the Lord and they lead us to spiritual death, but they also have temporal or earthly consequences. And it's just, it's just so powerful to be able to highlight this.

She could be thinking, what if he did say hi to Zach Low? Why didn't Zach Low say hi back to me? And now, you know what? By mean, this was unfair what Mina did to me because now I'm in the middle of this relationship with them that I had no pardon being. Because the other thing would be, that's how you did tell us Zach Low. And then what's he gonna say? Tell her, I said hello. Now, who are you? You're their butler? Like the old person butler?

Yeah, I can't count, you know, give me a break. I'm looking at DVOA and like, how is Pittsburgh? It can't be crap. That seems weird. Yeah, sometimes you, yeah. Oh, just sorry, you know, I was like, there's a clear top six. There's a clear top six, maybe seven with Cleveland. And then there's a lot of mid right now on you. Differentier.

Like you go through the top 10 offentists and they've had above average offent defensive performances in five of those games. And we've seen what they've done the last two weeks against the Packers and the Lions. So I've got the Eagles. I think their defense has been transformed by the Jalen Phillips trade, which I know you've talked about. Nicobie Dean coming back from injury where it was like it's even going to play this year.

Ravens, another team keeping an eye on, but I'm feeling much better about their defense now. Still don't think it's great, but much better. I know a lot of people are noticing Calla Hamilton what they're doing. Lamar is Lamar. Can bet on him, but the run games taking a step back. Derek Henry's slower this year.

If you have them in one spot and they are anything you look at statistically, ninth in EPA per drive, fourth in success rate, fifth in DVOA. It's not like just this fluke they're getting turnovers type thing. I have been really, really impressed by Kelvin Shepherd. When some of those corners come back, that's why I'm still pretty bullish on the lions because once December comes around, if they get healthier, I think they can be really, really good.

I watched that game and I'm like, he's got it. He's accurate. He's moving in the pocket and these aren't. This isn't the best supporting cast aside from McMillan. So listen, if you look at it statistically, the chances of him being like an actual guy, like a top 10 guy are very slim. I'm holding out hope that he's a guy where we say, hey, right situation, you know, good offensive line, add a couple more wide receivers where he can at least have one of those seasons where you're like, Bryce Young's having a moment right now.

Like once they get to the playoffs, you might be, you know, throwing some junk and just really, you know, manipulating quarterbacks and everything. So they might be just average right now in the regular season. I like the SawScar in their edition. A little pricey though, but I like that edition and it helps out a lot, but I still think this is more like the 14th best defense. You know, not like a true, true real, real contender. I can bet on. I'm not an offense and also you got the pumpkin factor with Daniel Jones. You just do. I know he's been playing well, but you got the pumpkin factor. So that's what I got there in there. Broncos.

He's bigger than people realize. He's not very tall, you know, six, one to change. But he's like two thirty. But he's like a stout dude and his balance is rare. I'm glad you brought the sack rate because that's where the time to throw a thing with Caleb has gone blown so out proportion. He's gone so much better from the pocket.

That's what's worrisome to me as well I know Josh Allen's always the project quarterback.

So it's like all those little ingredients I look for in a great defense. I feel like they've got it. They were blitzing on early downs and I think they were surprised by it because they're a point like this. It's like that blend of like sticking to your players and your identity, but changing the way you use them, the way they design, Mike McDonald designs pressure, I think is fascinating.

Rehearsed blooper. Yeah. No, I'm with you that we've all had those questions. And so Trevor Lawrence is the blooper real quarterback. And I don't think he's doing it on purpose where you just watch him, even you watch him last week, you know, they blow out the chargers, but you watch that game. There's an interception. Like the last one of the last plays is like a fourth down and he's like trying to, they're up by like 30 points or whatever it is.

Tamiko Rines resumes just longer against great quarterbacks and great offenses. He's done it in playoff games. He's done it against Josh Allen and other quarterbacks last year, where I feel like they're not going to level down when the competition is better.

It's like they get on base. That's what they do. So, okay, yes, the, the deep balls aren't all the way there, but I think they, like that'll even out. I think the defensive game games, it's just one of these things where it's like they don't have that true weakness. They're fine to good in a lot of areas that I, I think are true contender numbers.

So Texans can pull the upset. If the Colts lose to the Chiefs on Sunday, I know it's a lot of ifs, but Houston would only be two games out of first place.
