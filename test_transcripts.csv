Or no, sweetie. I, we're here to buy a birthday present for your cousin, but I'm not gonna buy anything else. You know, you see that thing you want. That's my boundary. And on your side is your feelings. So if you're my mom, your upset. And maybe your version of upset is tilting me, who knows, right?

It's a slippery slope that having a bad habit can lead to it, you know, being permanent. So we use this phrase mainly to warn someone of something that seems kind of small and insignificant being important and having bad consequences in the future.

I said no to my kid because I don't wanna buy them everything at a toy store and I feel guilty. It's not guilt. It's actually life changing.

This means, you know, you can come into my house, I'm inviting you in. Come in, come in. Another really important phrasal verb is lock up. So often times when you leave your house, you say, let me lock up real quick. This means you're going to make sure all the doors are secure and locked and the windows are closed as well.

Scripts are important to people even speaking their own native language. So she's talking about how you can name what you want to happen, why it can't happen, and trying to make adjustments for it here. Which I think is a really useful thing for setting boundaries or having to say no to someone. Let's focus on the last thing she was talking about. She says, oh Becky just doesn't want to be on my podcast."

She kind of asks the question right rhetorically. So she's not looking for an answer. She's just making sure you're following along. And she doesn't say right. She says it right, right. She kind stops and doesn't pronounce the T because she's speaking so quickly. Another really common filler or like transition word that English speakers use, especially native English speakers."

So I want you to practice this sentence that we were talking about here in the clip. Why are you spending so much time in my head? I would have just figured it out with you. I don't want you to say it like that, but I do want you to hear the words clearly. I want you to repeat after me. I'm gonna try to say exactly as the speaker in the podcast said it.

Open it up, open it up. I feel like one thing that is less common than it used to be is people to just drop by. The phrasal verb to drop by, it means to come by someone's house unexpectedly."

You don't have to write it all at the same time. You should break it up into smaller tasks.

The phrasal verb to keep up with is used in a few different contexts and it's very common. You might think of someone having to keep up with trends.
