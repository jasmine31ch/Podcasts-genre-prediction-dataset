Atlanta's defense is allowing the fewest passing yards per game. It's not a great matchup where you're targeting him.

You guys have convinced me to lower the Cardinals in general simply because that it will be Carter catching more passes and not a not a great match up against Jacksonville. There's also guys out there that are available in about half of leagues that aren't necessarily dealing with an injury ahead of them, but they are they're getting run. And that's Devon Tbilatory and Tyler Alger. Tyler Alger is used around the goal line, Ahton. The matchup against the Saints is like, okay, maybe this is maybe this is a game where you can be up.

And there's a part of me that's tempted to drop JJ for some roster flexibility right now. Caleb's buy is of course well behind him. But I might be able to sort of Jerry rig my quarterback.
